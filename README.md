## General info
This project is a web implemention of a toy called Etch-a-Sketch, done as an assignment from The Odin Project.
The purpose of this project, was to test my skills of pure JavaScript and DOM manipulation.
This project consisted of me doing a ton of googling and looking through documentations to figure out how certain things work and how to achieve a desirable output.
By tackling this project I learnt a ton of new stuff and solidified what I already knew about DOM manipulation.
